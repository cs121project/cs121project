<h3> About the project: </h3>
<p> We intend to make an electronic book with built-in consultant support and challenges. The electronic book/e-book will provide a brief description of the SDGs. The consultant support allows the users to choose from the provided questions and give the possible efficient answer. And there will be challenges to test your knowledge, and there will be a comparison if you improve or not. We will make this project using the Python programming language.</p>
